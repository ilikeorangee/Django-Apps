everything is divided into apps in django 
within those apps there are  pages, views, datas
it's way to organize 
add apps to settings 
convention i use
personal:mismatch pages collected 

i always build views first- try to see what I want to build looks alike 

template inside src directory-base.html
need to tell django where all the templates are 

inside settings.py, base dir -> point to src directory 
and inside templates I'm saying join the base directory with the template name templates

view-handles the logic(html- look)(view-backend)

class based -whole package view but confusing 
modify urls.py 


content-block: no need to write duplicate html
app -> templates -> again app because it will help django to find templates for the certain app: it's set this way in settings.py
so in views.py it will be templalte/personal/home.html but django takes care of template part so it's just personal/home

now using base.html extends that 


super user-django built in 
apply changes to database 

groups/users are basically database table 

Models: model the data in db, denote what table goes
query data into view and display that on template

create models -> cofigure using console->update admin.py 
update views.py -> update template

user-use for username 
we will create a custom user that will use an email  
create a new app account

override the defalut one with custom one in settings. py

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'account.Account'

we built in custom model
we will make a custom user registration
